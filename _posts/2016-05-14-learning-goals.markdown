Following are learning resources which I would be using to 
augment my knowledge. I have set a one year goal for this and 
Hope to acquire as much knowledge as possible. 
As there are large information to acquire, I will go in phased 
manner and will discuss the progress here in this blog.

* Learning a Tool  
  [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) A tool released by 
  google which can be used to create production quality machine 
  learning application.
  
* Online Courses  
Planning to take following courses  
   * [Harvard Datascience](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)  
     Taking this course to get familiarize with the tools used
 
   * [Miniting Massive Datasets](https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds)  
     This course is to understand the complexity involved while processing large dataset
   
   * [Stanford StatLearning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about)  
     Eventhough I am familiar with the topics which are discussed here, would like to refresh some of the concepts.</li>

   * [Deep Learning using Tensorflow](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)  
     To learn about Tensorflow

   * [Data science from life science](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-4-high-harvardx-ph525-4x-0)  
     To learn to handle high dimensional data
    
   * [Data science and Engineering with Spark](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-engineering-spark#courses)   
     Will try to get a certificate
   
   * [Computational Statistics in Python](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/index.html)  
     Learning using Python
   
   * [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci)
   * [Statistics Making sense of data](https://www.coursera.org/course/introstats)
   * [Scalable Machine Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS190.1x/1T2015/info)
   * [Stat101 from Harvard](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k101665)
   * [Tutorials from CompleityExplorer](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/tutorials)


* Deep Learning Resources  
   * [http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/)
   * [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
   * [Andrej Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/)

   * [Convolution Neural Network](http://cs231n.github.io/)
   * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

* Resources  
  Following resources I found has many materials which can help me with learning.
  
  * [Awesome datascience](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience)
  * [Open source data science masters](http://datasciencemasters.org/)
  * [Kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Tutorials)
  * [Zipfina Academy](http://www.zipfianacademy.com/blog/post/46864003608/a-practical-intro-to-data-science)

* IPython Notebooks  
  IPython notebooks is great way to apply the learning. 
  Here are some resources
  
  * [Big data with Apache Spark](https://katrinadataing.wordpress.com/2015/12/29/big-data-with-apache-spark/)
  * [Python Machine Learning Book](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book)

* Refresh the Basics
  * Review the Linear Algebra
  * Review of the probability concepts
  * [Statistics 101](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube)

* This Quora post has link to many resouces
  * [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-data-scientist-1)

* Extensive resource collection can be found [here](https://github.com/aymericdamien/Machine-Learning-Tutorials)

* Data Visulization  
  My plan also includes to learn D3. It will help to create great visualization using the data.
  
  * [D3 Turorial](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents)
  * Bokeh : Instead of D3 which requires the knowledge, it is better to learn Bokeh
  * I loved the presentation created using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). Easy to learn too.

* Some useful ebooks
  * [Think Series](http://greenteapress.com/wp/)
  * It has great eBooks like "Think Stats", "Think like a computer scientist".

* Other Courses
  * [Data Mining by MIT Sloan School of Management](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-062-data-mining-spring-2003/lecture-notes/)
